# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow helps you trigger a SonarCloud analysis of your code and populates
# GitHub Code Scanning alerts with the vulnerabilities found.
# Free for open source project.

# 1. Login to SonarCloud.io using your GitHub account

# 2. Import your project on SonarCloud
#     * Add your GitHub organization first, then add your repository as a new project.
#     * Please note that many languages are eligible for automatic analysis,
#       which means that the analysis will start automatically without the need to set up GitHub Actions.
#     * This behavior can be changed in Administration > Analysis Method.
#
# 3. Follow the SonarCloud in-product tutorial
#     * a. Copy/paste the Project Key and the Organization Key into the args parameter below
#          (You'll find this information in SonarCloud. Click on "Information" at the bottom left)
#
#     * b. Generate a new token and add it to your Github repository's secrets using the name SONAR_TOKEN
#          (On SonarCloud, click on your avatar on top-right > My account > Security
#           or go directly to https://sonarcloud.io/account/security/)

It seems you want to add steps for building and testing before analyzing with SonarCloud in the GitHub Actions workflow.

Here's a modification to your .yml file to include both build and test steps:

yaml
Copy code
name: SonarCloud analysis

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  pull-requests: read # allows SonarCloud to decorate PRs with analysis results

jobs:
  Analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checking out your code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Add build step here
      - name: Build the code
        run: |
          # Replace with your build commands
          echo "Building the project..."
          # For instance, if it's a Maven project:
          # mvn clean install

      # Add tests step here
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          # Replace with your test commands
          echo "Running tests..."
          # For instance, if it's a Maven project:
          # mvn test

      - name: Analyze with SonarCloud
        uses: SonarSource/sonarcloud-github-action@de2e56b42aa84d0b1c5b622644ac17e505c9a049
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Needed to get PR information
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}   # Generate a token on Sonarcloud.io, add it to the secrets of this repo with the name SONAR_TOKEN (Settings > Secrets > Actions > add new repository secret)
        with:
          args:
            -Dsonar.projectKey=
            -Dsonar.organization=
Note that the "Build the code" and "Run tests" steps are placeholder steps. You should replace the echo and potential mvn commands with the actual build and test commands that are relevant to your project. If your project uses a different build tool or has specific requirements, ensure you adjust the commands accordingly.

generate sonarcloud plugin defenition for adding to pom.xml

If you want to integrate SonarCloud with a Maven project, you'll typically update your pom.xml file with the necessary plugins and properties for SonarCloud.

Here's a typical setup for the pom.xml file to include the SonarCloud configuration:

xml
Copy code
<project>
  ...
  <properties>
    <!-- SonarCloud properties -->
    <sonar.host.url>https://sonarcloud.io</sonar.host.url>
    <sonar.organization>[your-organization-key]</sonar.organization>
    <sonar.projectKey>[your-project-key]</sonar.projectKey>
    <!-- Optional: Set to true to skip the analysis -->
    <!--<sonar.skip>true</sonar.skip>-->
  </properties>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <!-- SonarCloud Maven Plugin -->
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>sonar-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>[sonar-maven-plugin-version]</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>

  ...
</project>
Replace:

[your-organization-key] with the organization key you got from SonarCloud.
[your-project-key] with the project key you got from SonarCloud.
[sonar-maven-plugin-version] with the version of the Sonar Maven Plugin you intend to use. You can check for the latest version on Maven Central or on the SonarCloud documentation.
To run the SonarCloud analysis with Maven, you would typically use the following command:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=[your-sonar-token]
Replace [your-sonar-token] with the token you generated on SonarCloud. For security reasons, it's recommended not to hard-code the token in your pom.xml or source code. Instead, provide it as a command line argument or set it in a CI environment.
